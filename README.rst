======

Senlin is a clustering service for OpenStack cloud. It creates and operates
clusters of homogenous objects exposed by other OpenStack services. The
goal is to make orchestration of collections of similar objects easier.

Senlin provides ReSTful APIs to users so that they can associate various
policies to a cluster.  Sample policies include placement policy, load
balancing policy, failover policy, scaling policy, ... and so on.
